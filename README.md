# Password-Generator

## Description
For this assignment we were asked to write the JavaScript code for a functioning password generator.

## Installation
* The first thing I did was set up the prompt, confirm, and alert boxes
* Then I set up a counter that would log the answers to the password criteria questions </br> to ensure the user selects at least two before they can continue
* After I had the counter set up I made an alert that would let the user know they didn't meet the password criteria </br> and added a return to run the "askforoptions" function again
* Once I had the criteria set up I made a series of "if" statements to concatenate arrays of characters based off the user selections 
* When that was done I set up a for loop using Math.random to select a random group of characters from the aforementioned array
* After I had my new array of characters from the for loop I joined them into a string to be displayed in the password box

## Technologies Used
